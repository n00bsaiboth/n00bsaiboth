### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm happy to see you here. In other words, I'm glad that you found me. Now that I got your attention, I have a favor to ask you. I'm looking for new adventures.

My journey just has ended at or with [Citrus Solutions](https://citrussolutions.fi/) so now I'm looking for new adventures. I'm still working on with my CV and GitHub repositories (most of my recent work ended up or is behind Citrus walls), so that everything is up to date. In the meantime, if you know someone, who needs a guy, who knows something about PHP, Linux and cyber security, I'm your guy. Well, I know a thing or two about computers and networks and how do they work.

My role at Citrus was a full stack developer (LAMP-stack / web development), but I prefer the darkest corners at the office, so backend is more or less like my homefield. So I prefer the dark places, that no one likes, like module / drupal / php upgrades and or patching the existing ones. In two years, Citrus made me a quite good Drupalist. On that journey with Citrus, I came familiar with new technologies, like Azure, Docker, Gulp, Openshift, Platform.sh, and Webpack. Let's not forget about Jira, version control and Scrum and / or Agile. 

My supervisor at Citrus promised me to recommend me, so if you're interested, please contact him at, [joni.pinomÃ¤ki (at) citrus.fi](mailto:joni.pinomaki[at]citrus.fi) . He can tell you better how did I manage with the projects and customer support. Also I might have another recommender in mind, but I have to ask him first. All in all: I think I left a good impression about myself to Citrus customers/clients, I don't usually speak people, but when I do, I do it (mostly) for the customers.

So what are my strengths and weaknesses, you might ask. They actually go quite hand in hand. I'm quite good problem solver, fast learner and I love to documentate. Sometimes I might get stuck with a problem, and I'm so ambitious, that I want to solve the problem by myself and do not ask for a help. So that can be a bit time consuming. Like I told above, I'm not always at my best if I need to socialize with other people. I like to keep things by myself.

Normally my salary wish is around 2050-2550 euros/month (without taxes) but then again I can work as a freelancer, around 50-65 euros/hour, but because then I would be a light entrepreneur, so I have to take account of what Ukko or Eezy is taking off from the salary and that the salary is something, that I can cope with.

So if you're interested in me, who can be at the same time as bold as an unsecure, but proactive and still willing to learn more and who won't let you down. I'm your guy! [jussi.k.jokinen (at) gmail.com](mailto:jussi.k.jokinen[at]gmail.com).
