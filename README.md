### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm happy to see you here. In other words, I'm glad that you found me. Now that I got your attention, I have a favor to ask you. I'm looking for new adventures.

Normally my salary wish is around 2050-2550 euros/month (without taxes) but then again I can work as a freelancer, around 30-50 euros/hour, but because then I would be a light entrepreneur, so I have to take account of what Omapaja is taking off from the salary and that the salary is something, that I can cope with.

So if you're interested in me, who can be at the same time as bold as an unsecure, but proactive and still willing to learn more and who won't let you down. I'm your guy! [jussi.jokinen (at) openinnovations.io](mailto:jussi.jokinen[at]openinnovations.io).
