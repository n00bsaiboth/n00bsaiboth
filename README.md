### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm happy to see you here. In other words, I'm glad that you found me. Now that I got your attention, I have a favor to ask you. I'm looking for new adventures.

By adventures I mean a full time or a part time job. On a full time job, my salary wish is around 2050-2550 euros/month (without taxes) and as a part time or freelancer job the salary wish is around 30-50 euros/hour.

A bit of about myself:
- Drop out from Turku University of Applied Sciences, so basically and mostly self-taught, but there are few short courses in addition.
- Previous work experience: I was working in Citrus for 2 years as a Drupalist.
- Favorite stacks: LAMP and MERN.
- Favorite OS: Debian and Arch Linux.
- Also iterested in DevOps and cyber security.
- Got the right attitude and willing and eager to learn more (humblebly).
- When it comes to problem solving or trouble shooting. I don't get bored, bothered or frustrated so easy.
- I'm at my home field, when working with Linux and backend, but also the frontend is doable.
- Love to do documentation.

I'm not quite ready to step into anyone's boots, because I'm a bit insecure and don't know what people or companies expect from me. Even though, I might be a bit insecure, I'll fulfill that gap with enthusiasm and can do attitude. 

To play it safe: I'm looking for trainee- or junior positions, even though my skill level might be a bit above than that.

Also I got this one more favor to ask you. If you could use your network and "advertise me", that you know a guy who is looking for work. It can be your co-worker, your husband or wife, your neighbour or your neigbour's dog. That would be great.

I've been unemployed almost a year now, but I've keeping myself busy.
- [develop.openinnovations.io](https://develop.openinnovations.io) this project is based on the [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com) course material. Still in progress.
- [virtual-server.openinnovations.io](https://virtual-server.openinnovations.io) this project is based on the [tieto.nurminen.dev](https://tieto.nurminen.dev).
- [documentation.openinnovations.io](https://documentation.openinnovations.io) this is our documentation project.
- Among other small things like LAMP and MERN projects, Linux configurations, etc..

So if you're interested in me, who can be at the same time as bold as an insecure, but proactive and still willing to learn more and who won't let you down. I'm your guy! [jussi.jokinen (at) openinnovations.io](mailto:jussi.jokinen[at]openinnovations.io).
