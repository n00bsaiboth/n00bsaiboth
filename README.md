### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm happy to see you here. In other words, I'm glad that you found me. Now that I got your attention, I have a favor to ask you. 

My journey just has ended at or with [Citrus Solutions](https://citrussolutions.fi/) so now I'm looking for new adventures. I'm still working on with my CV and GitHub repositories (most of my current work is behind Citrus walls), so that everything is up to date. In the meantime, if you know someone, who needs a guy, who knows something about PHP, Linux and cyber security, I'm your guy. 

My role at Citrus was a full stack developer (LAMP-stack / web development), but I prefer the darkest corners at the office, so backend is more or less like my homefield. So I prefer the dark places, that no one likes, like module / drupal / php upgrades and or patching the existing ones. In two years, Citrus made me a quite good Drupalist. On that journey with Citrus, I came familiar with new technologies, like Azure, Docker, Gulp, Openshift, Platform.sh, and Webpack. 

My supervisor at Citrus promised me to recommend me, so if you're interested, please contact him at, [joni.pinomÃ¤ki (at) citrus.fi](mailto:joni.pinomaki [at] citrus.fi) . He can tell you better how did I manage with the projects and customer support. I know that I'm walking on a thin ice here, but also Mikko Samuli from Doop, might want to say a word about me. I didn't ask him as a recemmonder, but we do have work together around 2 years, so he know's a lot about me. You can contact Mikko at, [mikko.samuli (at) doop.fi](mailto:mikko.samuli [at] doop.fi). All in all: I think I left a good impression about myself to Citrus customers/clients, I don't usually speak people, but when I do, I do it for the customers. 

So now you have to ask me what are my strenghts and weaknesess, this is a tough one. My strenghts are that I'm quite agile (and a fast learner and that if I'm stuck, I can ask for help, if needed), even though, I'm not so exprerienced. I'm a quite good debugger, listener and I like to document a lot. Weaknesess, it only needs a one rotten apple, to rock the boat. That is one thing that happened on Citrus, one bad co-worker with his/her mindgames and it ruined it all. 

Normally my salary wish is around 2050-2550 euros/month (without taxes) but then again I can work as a freelancer, around 50-65 euros/hour, because then I would be a light entrepreneur. So I need to take care of myself.

So if you're interested in me, who can be at the same time as bold as an unsecure, but proactive and still willing to learn more and who won't let you down. I'm your guy! [jussi.k.jokinen (at) gmail.com](mailto:jussi.k.jokinen [at] gmail.com).
