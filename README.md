### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm happy to see you here. In other words, I'm glad that you found me. If you have been here before, you might recall that I was looking for a job, well these days are over. At the moment, I'm working at Citrus as a software developer trainee. So, no more web development for me at my spare time at least for money. Although, I can work as an consultant.
